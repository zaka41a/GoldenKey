# GoldenKey ‚Äî Frontend (React only)

GoldenKey is a lightweight hotel web app with a **marketing landing** and a **self-service ‚ÄúMy bookings‚Äù** page.  
This repository contains **only the React frontend** (the PHP backend was removed). The UI can run entirely with **local mocks**, and can later connect to a real API by setting one environment variable.
